= jMolecules - Architectural abstractions for Java

This repository contains libraries to help developers work with architectural concepts in Java.
It currently consists of the following artifacts:

== Artifacts to express DDD concepts
* link:jmolecules-ddd[`jmolecules-core`] -- annotations and interfaces to express DDD building blocks (value objects, entities, aggregate roots etc.) in code.
* link:jmolecules-events[`jmolecules-events`] -- annotations and interfaces to express the concept of events in code.
* link:jmolecules-architecture[`jmolecules-architecture`] -- annotations to express architectural styles in code.
** link:jmolecules-architecture/jmolecules-architecture-layered[`jmolecules-architecture-layered`] -- Layered architecture
*** `@DomainLayer`
*** `@ApplicationLayer`
*** `@InfrastuctureLayer`
*** `@InterfaceLayer`
** link:jmolecules-architecture/jmolecules-architecture-onion[`jmolecules-architecture-onion`] -- Onion architecture
*** **Classic**
**** `@DomainModelRing`
**** `@DomainServiceRing`
**** `@ApplicationServiceRing`
**** `@InfrastructureRing`
*** **Simplified** (does not separate domain model and services)
**** `@DomainRing`
**** `@ApplicationRing`
**** `@InfrastructureRing`

== Technology integration
* link:jmolecules-archunit[`jmolecules-archunit`] -- ArchUnit rules that verify the aggregate structures in your model.
* link:jmolecules-jpa[`jmolecules-jpa`] -- A ByteBuddy plugin to derive default JPA mappings for code that expresses DDD building blocks via `jmolecules-core`.
* link:jmolecules-jpa[`jmolecules-spring`] -- A ByteBuddy plugin to derive Spring component annotations for code that expresses DDD building blocks via `jmolecules-core`.

== Examples
* link:jmolecules-examples[`jmolecules-examples`] -- A collection of examples to showcase the usage of the concept types and annotations as well as the technology integration.

== Release instructions

* `mvn release:prepare -DscmReleaseCommitComment="$ticketId - Release version $version." -DscmDevelopmentCommitComment="$ticketId - Prepare next development iteration."`
* `mvn release:perform`
